# Front End Web Developer Nanodegree - Capstone Project: Travel Planner Web App

This is a project to [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/us)'s Front End Web Developer nanodegree.

## Overview

This is a one-page web application that includes a simple form for you to enter the location you're going to and the date you're leaving. If your trip is within a week, you will receive the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will receive a predictive forecast.
